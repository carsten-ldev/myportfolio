## My portfolio

This is a Next.js project that utilizes the GitHub api to fetch starred projects from my github profile to display them on the website.

If You are not viewing this page from the portfolio website, it can be viewed live here: https://myportfolio-kappa-sand.vercel.app

The read more page on each repo is fetched and converted to html with the npm-package 'marked'.

Since the html from readme files cannot be styled with Tailwind, styles for the details page is found in global.css
